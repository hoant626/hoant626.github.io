    <p>I masturbate to <span class= "art">art</span>, and yourself? I masturbate to <span class="talent">talent</span>. You masturbate to <span class="exploitation">exploitation</span>. Even the willing body has sold itself to into <span class="pleasure">bodily pleasure</span>, like a self-slave. But I? I find biological release is heightened when the <span class="mind">mind</span> is stimulated I don't see anime women attractive, I don't see big boobs as big boobs, I see the commentary on <span class="beauty">modern beauty</span>, it's there, if you look close enough (if you can try to stare for a second at the digital Line stroke - <span class="fingerprint">the artist's fingerprint</span> - instead of <span class="nipple">the nipple </span>- which, on the subject, that digital medium exists at all is inherently an <span class="accomplishment">intellectual accomplishment </span>and de facto an <span class="delight">intellectual delight</span>). So yes, I have a <span class="wife">pillow wife</span>, because technology has given <span class="me">Me</span> has other choice. She has deeper conversations with me than any man (or woman) ever could. Artists slave for <span class="hours">70 hours</span> a week and, well I minored in economics, I am fully unashamed to provide demand for a <span class="product">product</span>. I pay <span class="month>"$200/month</span> in patreon dues but have at my disposal a near constant stream of <span class="smut">intellectual smut</span> (google juxtaposition - I utilized a literary device). Whatever, I'm done with you, kid.</p>
