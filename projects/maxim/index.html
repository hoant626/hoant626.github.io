        <p class ="post">i decided 2 write down my train of thought nd see how the human mind (well, my mind at least) works<br>
        its kindda long, srry<br>
        this is wht i got:<br>
        "Sometimes I wonder wht it wud feel like if I was never born...<br>
        Wud it feel like death? Wud it feel like u were closing ur eyes 4ever?<br>
        I wonder how i use 2 think when i was baby.......<br>
        Did i think of sumthing nd completly forget after 3 seconds like a fish? or did i just went on auto piliot?<br>
        Maybe I was on auto pilot...but i seemed so clueless<br>
        ahhh CLue..thts a fun game<br>
        Clue Jr was weird tho<br>
        They had books about tht game, i never solved any of the mysteries tho<br>
        but i was in 3rd grade<br>
        ahh my favorite teacher was my 3rd grade teacher, she was nice<br>
        sure missed her, specially in 4th grade at the kilmer<br>
        i left some friends, well a friend, all my friends left b4 me :(<br>
        but yeh i was scared of my 4th grade teacher.....<br>
        not the best first impression of the kilmer<br>
        well it got better the next year....WHO AM I KIDDING<br>
        5th grade teacher was pretty stupid, never learned less stuff in my life<br>
        it was like going 2 ccd everyday<br>
        but 6th grade was a LOT better<br>
        but of course tht had 2 end.......<br>
        but now im at bls, so i guess thts gud<br>
        i mean it pretty makes the impression tht im smart, tho it takes me 30 min 2 memorize a little line<br>
        tht reminds me.....<br>
        i have 2 study for the national myth exam<br>
        the myth exam....<br>
        gud thing its not gonna be on a tuesday tho cuz i have ccd....<br>
        well maybe it shud be on tuesday then so maybe i can miss it again<br>
        wait no it cant be on tuesday cuz i have my ortho appointment tht tuesday<br>
        ugh no<br>
        y cant i have ortho on fridays? or mondays?<br>
        not thursdays...my mom works late tht day<br>
        nd i dont wanna take the bus home<br>
        donuts<br>
        tht was random"<br>
