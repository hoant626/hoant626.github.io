        Hey, kids. This is the story of how I met your father. <span class="number1"></span> years ago, I was at <span class="placeInNewYork"></span> with <span class="artistName"></span>. We were looking at some <span class="pluralNoun1"></span> lying on the ground when we saw a <span class="noun1"></span> go by. I didn't think much of it, until I saw a <span class="adjective2"></span> person inside. I ran up to the <span class="noun1"></span> until it stopped and the person walked out. I asked them for their name and they said, "<span class="celebrityName"></span>." My <span class="bodyPart"></span> started beating. They gave me their contact information with a <span class="artSupply"></span> and we parted ways. I saw a <span class="noun2"></span> in the sky, the symbol of love, and knew things would go well for me.
        <br><br>
        That night, I went on <span class="computerSoftware"></span> and messaged <span class="celebrityName"></span>. We found that we had a lot in common! We both had a passion for <span class="pluralNoun2"></span>, and were even part of the same online community, <span class="websiteName"></span>! I asked them if they wanted to go <span class="verbEndingInIng"></span> the next day, and they said yes.
        <br><br>
        The next day, we met up. Before <span class="verbEndingInIng"></span>, <span class="celebrityName"></span> gave me some <span class="pluralNoun3"></span> as a gift. They were so <span class="adjective1"></span>! We went <span class="verbEndingInIng"></span> and then for dinner we shared <span class="foods"></span>. It was the perfect ending to a perfect date. We dated for <span class="number2"></span> years until we got married, and here we are! That's basically how I met your father.
