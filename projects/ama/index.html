        <p class="answer">I don‚Äôt really think I have a type honestly. I like guys who either have light hair (gingers!!) or who have darker features (dark brown/ black hair). I don‚Äôt like skinny guys so they don‚Äôt have to be super fit but I don‚Äôt like guys who are thinner than I am. Ideally, he‚Äôd be taller than me (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù).<br>I think that I need to be with someone who at least has some type of plan for their life. They don‚Äôt have to have it all figured it, but they need to have some ambition or goal they want to achieve. They need to be self sufficient and able to take care of themselves. I‚Äôm a very low energy person, so I‚Äôd like them to have higher energy than I do, otherwise we‚Äôd just do nothing all day. They also need to be sure of themselves as a person. I don‚Äôt want to be with someone who constantly flip flops between different extremes or says one thing but does another. They don‚Äôt necessarily need to take care of me because I know I can take care of me but I‚Äôd like to know that I can trust them to take care of me if I never need them to. They also need to respect me, my beliefs, and the goals I have for my life and be supportive of those things, which I think should exist in any relationship. </p>

They also have to be funny and get my sense of humor because if they don‚Äôt its awkward. They also have to be relatively clean (not necessarily all on it but not gross). They also have to be interested in hearing about the books I read and tell me about the article they read on the New York Times that morning, y‚Äôknow? I would also hope they‚Äôd like a little romance and surprises and to have fun. Looks wise, I literally don‚Äôt care really. I like guys that are tall, short, light hair, dark hair.

        <p class="answer">Because it‚Äôs so rare for me to encounter people taller than me, height is usually the first thing I register when I start feeling attracted to someone. My ‚Äútype‚Äù is someone who is tall enough for me to wear heeled shoes around without feeling self-conscious. I find myself predisposed towards thinking Asians/ half-Asians are especially attractive, though that doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt find white men attractive at all. Otherwise, other physical factors aren‚Äôt as important to me. In terms of personality, I especially value people who I feel like I can comfortably share intimate and open-minded conversations with. I feel so uncomfortable when talking to people who aren‚Äôt attune to their emotions because it feels like conversation becomes limited from the get-go. So I really appreciate it when men can be ~vulnerable~ with their emotions. It would also be ideal if we shared in some of the same passions, but not all, so that there is opportunity for us to enjoy the things we love together but also to teach and learn from eachother new things about the world that captivate us. Despite all these conditions though, I ultimately just want to feel reciprocated love and loyalty. </p>
